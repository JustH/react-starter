# Scholarships Project Charter

## Identification
The scholarships application manages the application, reviewing, awarding, criteria matching, allocation of funds, donor management, and reporting for scholarships activity at UW Foster School of Business

## Background
The current system is not meeting the needs of the staff at UW Foster.  Various paper processes are still in place which are costly and prone to errors. The usability and reliability of the current system is below current standards.

## Purpose
- To replace the current outdated online system / paper based workflow that UW Foster currently has.
- To add in Gradute scholarships to the process, which are not in the current web app.
- To add in better reporting and visualization of allocation tools
- To improve the usability of the app for students and staff

## Goals and Objectives
Launch a new application via an interative, lean, agile approach. Set up the application to be maintainable, in order to continuously deliver new features and reduce maintenance costs.
